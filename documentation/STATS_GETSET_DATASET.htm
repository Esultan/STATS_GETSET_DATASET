<h1>Open an SPSS Dataset with a Dataset Name</h1>
<p>
Any data file opened or created in SPSS Statistics is a dataset.  
It may or may not
have a dataset name. A name allows it to be referred to in syntax in order
to make it the active dataset or to perform other operations involving
datasets.  A dataset that does not have a name will be closed if a 
different dataset is made active.
</p>
<p>A dataset name is automatically assigned when data are opened via
the user interface.  However, the name may be different each time the
data file is opened.  This dialog provides a way to assign a permanent
dataset name to an SPSS data file (.SAV or .ZSAV).  That name will be
applied if the data file is opened using this dialog or is opened with
the STATS GETSET DATASET command.
</p>
<p>This dialog provides two possible actions: 
<ul>
<li> assign a permanent
dataset name to be saved when the dataset is written to a file, and </li>
<li>open a data file applying the permanent dataset name, if any,
to it</li>
</ul>
You can use either or both at the same time.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Assign permanent dataset name</span> Use this
section to assign a permanent name to the active dataset that will
be saved when the dataset is saved as an SAV or ZSAV file.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Dataset Name Source</span> If the active
dataset already has a dataset name, you can set that as the permanent name.
Alternatively, choose the second button and specify a permanent name
in the Dataset Name field.  The dataset name within the current session
will also be changed to the specified name.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Open a File</span> Use this section to open
a SAV or ZSAV file that has a permanent dataset name attribute and
assign that dataset name in the current session.  If the file does not
contain a permanent name, a name will be assigned for the session.</p>

<p class="bullet">&bull; You can use 
File > Display Data File Information > External File to see the saved name,
which will be stored as the custom attribute named PermanentDSName.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Dataset Name Conflicts</span> If the permanent
name is already in use for another dataset when the file is opened,
the conflict will be resolved according to this setting.  Choose the
first button to not assign a name and the second to assign the
name anyway, removing it from the other dataset, which will then
not have a name and will be closed without saving any changes.
Reassigning the name for the currently active dataset is not
considered a conflict.</p>


<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>
This dialog generates syntax for the STATS GETSET DATASET
extension command.  To get the syntax help, use
<span class="code">STATS GETSET DATASET /HELP.</span><br>
or in Version 23 or later press F1 on the command name in the Syntax Editor.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
This command requires the Python Essentials
extension command from the SPSS Community website
