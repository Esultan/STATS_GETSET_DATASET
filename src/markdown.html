<p>
Any data file opened or created in SPSS Statistics is a dataset.  
It may or may not
have a dataset name. A name allows it to be referred to in syntax in order
to make it the active dataset or to perform other operations involving
datasets.  A dataset that does not have a name will be closed if a 
different dataset is made active.
</p>
<p>A dataset name is automatically assigned when data are opened via
the user interface.  However, the name may be different 
each time the data file is opened.  (Names are not automatically assigned when
the data are read using syntax.)
</p>
This command provides a way to assign a permanent
dataset name to an SPSS data file (.SAV or .ZSAV).  That name can be
applied if the data file is opened using this command.
</p>
<p>The command provides two possible actions: 
<ul>
<li> assign a permanent
dataset name to be saved when the dataset is written to a file, and </li>
<li>open a data file applying the permanent dataset name, if any,
to it</li>
</ul>
You can use either or both at the same time.
</p>


<p><strong>FILE</strong> specifies the name of an SAV or ZSAV
data file to be opened.  If the file contains a permanent dataset
name, that name is assigned to the opened dataset.</p>

<p><strong>CONFLICT</strong> specifies what to do if the
dataset name is already in use.  By default, no dataset name
is assigned.  Specifying <em>OVERRIDE</em> causes the name
to be transferred to the newly opened dataset.  Since the
name is removed from the previous holder and the newly opened
one becomes active, the other dataset is closed without
saving any changes.  Taking the name of the active dataset
is not considered a conflict.</p>

<p>The remaining keywords are used to create a permanent dataset name.</p>

<p><strong>ASSIGNCUSTOMDSN</strong> and <strong>ASSIGNSESSIONDSN</strong>
specify that a custom dataset name or the current dataset name of
the active dataset should be set as the permanent dataset name.
It will be saved when the dataset is saved as an SAV or ZSAV file.</p>
<p>The custom name to be assigned is specified with
<strong>CUSTOMDSN</strong>.
