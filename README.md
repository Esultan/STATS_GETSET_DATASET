# STATS_GETSET_DATASET
## Open an SPSS file and apply a permanent dataset name to the r  esulting dataset.
This command provides a way to assign a permanent dataset name to an SPSS data file (.SAV or .ZSAV). That name can subsequently be applied to the session if the data file is opened using this command. The command provides two possible actions:  assign a permanent dataset name to be saved when the dataset is written to a file, and open a data file applying the permanent dataset name, if any, to it
